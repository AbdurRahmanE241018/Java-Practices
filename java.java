/*
The Relational Operators
There are following relational operators supported by Java language.
Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then âˆ’ Operator Description Example
== (equal to)
Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
(A == B) is not true.
!= (not equal to)
Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
(A != B) is true.
> (greater than)
Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
(A > B) is not true.
< (less than)
Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
(A < B) is true.
>= (greater than or equal to)
Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
(A >= B) is not true.
<= (less than or equal to)
Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
(A <= B) is true.
